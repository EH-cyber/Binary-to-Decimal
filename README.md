# Binary-to-Decimal

This will currently give you the ability to convert base 10 numbers to base 2 (binary) numbers.  I am working on updating the code to allow for a fourth and fifth option in which users would be able to also convert to and from hex.  With that a seventh and eighth option may ensue which would allow for the conversion from hex to base 10.

Update: 22 August 2025
Created newBinary.py
    This is the updated version of the program and will be the one updated. It will consist of updated comments and functions.
