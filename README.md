# Binary-to-Decimal

This will currently give you the ability to convert base 10 numbers to base 2 (binary) numbers.  I am working on updating the code to allow for a fourth and fifth option in which users would be able to also convert to and from hex.  With that a seventh and eighth option may ensue which would allow for the conversion from hex to base 10.
